By default, Dyte uploads all recordings to Dyte's S3 bucket in the AWS ap-south-1 region. However, Dyte provides users with the flexibility to choose whether or not to upload their recordings to Dyte's S3 bucket.\r\n\r\n#     If you wish to disable uploads to Dyte's bucket, you can set the `dyte_bucket_config` parameter to false in the .\r\n\r\n# - question: |-\r\n#     What is the average file size of a Dyte recording?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical', 'Recording']\r\n#   answer: |-\r\n#     Based on historical data, here are estimations for recording sizes with different components:\r\n\r\n#     - Format: H264 video codec\r\n#     - Resolution: 720p\r\n#     - Duration: 1 hour\r\n#     - Estimated size: On average, around 230MB\r\n#     - Range: Typically falls between 200-250MB, with potential outliers for static or rapidly changing content.\r\n\r\n#     Please note that these estimations are based on historical data and apply to recordings with a resolution of 720p. Actual sizes may vary depending on factors such as content, codec settings, and resolution.\r\n\r\n# - question: |-\r\n#     What if our server fails to consume the webhook? When will they be fired\r\n#     again, and are they idempotent?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical']\r\n#   answer: |-\r\n#     For timeouts and 5xx errors, we retry three times with a one-second delay\r\n#     between each retry.\r\n\r\n# - question: Is it possible to get the total running time of a session from the meeting.ended webhook?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical']\r\n#   answer: |-\r\n#     We send `startedAt` and `endedAt` timestamps in a `meeting.ended` webhook\r\n#     that can be used to compute the session's running time.\r\n\r\n# - question: What is the expected delay in the livestream, and what happens if it exceeds the expected delay?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']\r\n#   answer: Typically, there is a 3-5 second lag in all livestreams. If the delay exceeds 10 seconds, users can \"Skip to Live,\" which involves dropping frames in order to synchronize the user's video with the live stream. Once the videos are synced, we stop dropping frames until the time exceeds 10 seconds again.\r\n\r\n# - question: What is the maximum number of hosts and viewers allowed to participate in a livestream?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']\r\n#   answer: Dyte's Interactive Livestreaming (ILS) can currently accommodate 10,000 viewers and 100 hosts on a single livestream.\r\n\r\n# - question: What is the maximum number of users that the livestream can handle, and how does this impact its quality?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']\r\n#   answer: Currently, our platform can support up to 10,000 viewers in a single livestream, and the quality of the stream is not affected by the number of viewers. However, an increase in the number of users may impact other features such as chats and polls.\r\n\r\n# - question: How do I manage viewer permissions for a livestream?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']\r\n#   answer: You can manage the permissions for a viewer using presets. For livestreaming, you must create two presets. One preset is for the livestreaming host, while the other is for the livestreaming viewer. For details, see Create [Presets](/dev/vscode/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).\r\n\r\n# - question: Can I join the livestream as a host in the middle of the livestream?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']\r\n#   answer: Yes, you can. However, ensure that you've the required preset permissions. For details, see Create [Presets](/dev/vscode/getting-started-with-livestreaming#step-2-create-presets).\r\n\r\n# - question: What permissions does a host require to start a livestream?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical', 'Livestreaming']\r\n#   answer: The host requires certain host controls such as the ability to Kick Participants, Mute Audio, Mute Video, and Pin Participant, as well as media permissions like Start Livestream and Admit or remove participants from the livestream.

However, it's important to keep the stream key private as it grants access to the live stream. Therefore, users should be informed to keep their stream key secure.\r\n\r\n#     For more information, see [Live Stream Custom Video Input via RTMP](/dev/vscode/livestream-any-rtmp).\r\n\r\n# - question: |-\r\n#     I'm encountering audio and video problems while developing a live video\r\n#     solution for my app. I'm using Chrome to test the microphone and camera.\r\n#     What could be causing this?\r\n#   tags: ['Technical']\r\n#   answer: |-\r\n#     The issue could be due to the security features implemented by the\r\n#     browser. Most of the standard browsers with best security practices restrict\r\n#     many features to HTTPS instead of HTTP. You can read about the details of\r\n#     the features that are restricted in Chrome\r\n#     [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins).\r\n\r\n#     To troubleshoot, we recommend trying the steps mentioned in this\r\n#     [document](https://web.dev/how-to-use-local-https/). If this does not\r\n#     resolve the issue, you can try using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) as an\r\n#     alternative solution.\r\n\r\n#     To use ngrok, download the software and run it with the local port\r\n#     specified. This generates an HTTPS URL that you can use for testing the\r\n#     microphone and camera.\r\n\r\n#     1. Download ngrok.\r\n\r\n#     2. Run the command 'ngrok http PUT_LOCAL_PORT_HERE'.\r\n\r\n#     3. Use the HTTPS URL to test your microphone and camera.\r\n\r\n# #\r\n# # Pricing FAQs\r\n# #\r\n\r\n# - question: How do I make a payment?\r\n#   tags: ['Pricing']\r\n#   answer: |-\r\n#     Once Dyte has generated an invoice, you can pay using a link, a saved card, or do a direct bank transfer.\r\n");var h=t(5712);const g=m.reduce(((e,n)=>{if(!n.tags)return e;for(const t of n.tags)e.includes(t)||e.push(t);return e}),[]);function p({title:e,children:n,open:t,onOpen:a,onClose:o}){const l=(0,d.o)(e),u=l+"-panel",m=()=>{t?(o(),history.pushState({},"","")):(a(),history.pushState({},"","#"+l))};return r.createElement("div",{id:"parent-"+l,className:(0,i.Z)("dyte-accordion cursor-pointer border-0 border-solid last-of-type:border-0",t?"mb-4 rounded-2xl bg-secondary-800":"border-b border-zinc-300 dark:border-zinc-700"),role:"tab","aria-expanded":t,"aria-controls":u},r.createElement("div",{role:"heading",className:(0,i.Z)("flex w-full cursor-pointer select-none items-center justify-between gap-4 border-0 border-solid bg-transparent p-6",t&&"!pb-0 text-primary dark:text-primary-100"),tabIndex:0,onClick:m,onKeyDown:e=>{"Enter"!==e.key&&" "!==e.key||(e.preventDefault(),m())},id:l},r.createElement("h3",{id:l,className:"text-lg font-semibold"},e),r.createElement("div",{className:"text-zinc-300"},r.createElement(s.Z,{className:(0,i.Z)("h-4 w-4 text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-300",!t&&"hidden")}),r.createElement(c.Z,{className:(0,i.Z)("h-4 w-4 text-primary-100",t?"hidden":"block")}))),r.createElement("div",{role:"region",id:u,"aria-labelledby":l,className:(0,i.Z)("accordion-content p-6 !pt-0",t?"block":"hidden")},n))}function y(){const[e,n]=(0,r.useState)(""),[t,s]=(0,r.useState)(""),[c,y]=(0,r.useState)("All");(0,r.useEffect)((()=>{if("undefined"==typeof window)return;const e=window.location.hash.substring(1);var t;""!==e&&(n(e),null===(t=document.querySelector("#parent-"+e))||void 0===t||t.scrollIntoView({behavior:"smooth",block:"center",inline:"center"}))}),[]);const f=(0,r.useMemo)((()=>""===t.trim()?"All"===c?m:m.filter((e=>e.tags.includes(c))):m.filter((e=>(e.question+" "+e.answer+" "+e.tags.join(" ")).toLowerCase().includes(t.toLowerCase())))),[c,t]);function w({tag:e}){return r.createElement("button",{className:(0,i.Z)("cursor-pointer rounded-md border-none px-3.5 py-1.5 font-nanum text-sm font-medium",c===e?"bg-primary text-white":"bg-secondary-800 text-black dark:text-white"),"data-tag":e,onClick:()=>y(e)},e)}return r.createElement(a.Z,{wrapperClassName:"faq-page bg-secondary-1000",noFooter:!0},r.createElement("section",{className:"noise-bg px-6 py-24"},r.createElement("div",{className:"mx-auto flex max-w-7xl flex-col place-items-center justify-center"},r.createElement("div",{className:"font-semibold text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-300"},"Frequently Asked Questions"),r.createElement("div",{className:"my-8 text-center text-4xl font-bold leading-tight text-zinc-800 dark:text-zinc-100 lg:text-6xl"},r.createElement("div",null,"Any questions?")),r.createElement("div",{className:"relative flex w-full max-w-md items-center text-zinc-700 dark:text-white"},r.createElement(l.Z,{className:"z-10 h-5 w-5 translate-x-1.5"}),r.createElement("input",{type:"text",className:"-ml-5 h-10 flex-1 rounded-md border border-solid border-zinc-200 bg-white px-3 pl-8 text-sm text-zinc-700 dark:border-zinc-800 dark:bg-secondary-1000 dark:text-zinc-200",placeholder:"\uac80\uc0c9",value:t,onInput:e=>s(e.currentTarget.value)})))),r.createElement("section",{className:"mb-20 px-6 py-12"},r.createElement("div",{className:"mx-auto max-w-7xl"},""!==t.trim()?0===f.length?r.createElement("div",{className:"mb-12 text-2xl font-semibold"},"\u2757\ufe0f \ud574\ub2f9 \ub2e8\uc5b4\ub97c \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ucc3e\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4."):r.createElement("div",{className:"mb-12 text-xl font-semibold"},'\u2755 "',t,'" \uc758 \uac80\uc0c9 \uacb0\uacfc\uc785\ub2c8\ub2e4.
